## Context

For a lots situation, we don't need to visit code, just by git & cloc, we can build most information. In this case, we
need a light version with Coca.

For this version, it can support those features:

1. analysis code from top to bottom with `cloc`.
2. analysis todo with antlr4
3. analysis git history with `git`
4. analysis `imports` for major languages:
    - c++
    - golang
    - java
    - kotlin
    - javascript

if we need more useful features, we can also do:

1. analysis dependencies
